# Odin Recipes

This is the first project from TOP to practice using only HTML to build a website. 

I had several challenges:
- Figuring out how to resize images because they were too large. I shrinked the images by adjusting the width.
- How to properly give credit to the photographer/image creator.
- First time dealing with markdown documents. I learned why markdown is used and its syntax.
- Could not navigate to the homepage after viewing individual recipes. This was easily fixed by adding a "return to main" link.

By the end of it, I became very comfortable with the basic HTML structure of a webpage, as well as creating ordered and unordered lists. I am also more familiar with markdown documents.
